📜 How to navigate the FitTrack App - 
Navigating FitTrack is simple and intuitive. When you first open the app, you’ll see a welcoming hero banner along with a section that explains the benefits of tracking your fitness, helping you stay motivated and consistent. Right below that, the dashboard displays your key statistics, including total workouts, total minutes trained, total calories burned, and your average workout duration. These numbers update automatically whenever you log a new workout. To add a workout, simply scroll down to the “Log New Workout” form. Fill in the workout name, date (which defaults to today), workout type, and details for each exercise, including name, duration, and calories burned. You can add multiple exercises by clicking the “+ Add Another Exercise” button, and you can remove any exercise if needed.
